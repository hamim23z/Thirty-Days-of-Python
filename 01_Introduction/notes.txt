Day 01 - Introduction
All code is in the main_code.py file
**



**Checking Version**
    • python --version
    • python3 --version


**Python Shell**
    • Access it by just typing in "python" in terminal. You'll know you're in 
    the shell when you see >>>
    • To exit the shell, type in "exit()"


**Basic Python and Syntax**
    • Python can be written in the shell or in an IDE, like how I'm doing it right now. 
    • Indentation matters a lot in Python, Python uses indentation to create blocks of code
    • There are two different ways to write Python comments:
        • Single Line: # Hello
        • Multi Line: """ Hello """


**Data Types**
    • Some of the most common data types that we will be using are
        • Integers
        • Floats
        • Strings
        • Booleans: For Python, the T and F are always capital, so True and False

    • More complex data types are the following
        • List: An ordered collection that can store different data types. 
        • Dictionary: An on object that is an unordered collection of data in a key value and pair format. 
        • Tuple: An ordered collection that can store different data types, but it cannot be modified once
        it has been created. 
        • Set: A collection of data types that is not an ordered collection of items and it can only store
        unique items. 


**Checking Data Types**
    • To check the data type of a certain variable or data, we use the built in Python type function
