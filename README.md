# Thirty Days of Python - Course by Asabeneh


### Project Recap

This repo is my work for the Thirty Days of Python course provided by Asabeneh. The purpose of doing this project
is to sharpen my skills in Python and learn more about the language. Python is my favorite language to use and mastering 
it is something that I want to do. Also included are my own Quizzes generated by ChatGPT and ClaudeAI. These quizzes happen 
every 5 days and test my knowledge and syntax skills. His course can be found at https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python
