Operators
    • There are many different types of operators in Python. The first being the assignment operator
    which is the most common. Example: x = 10, name - "Hamim"

    
    • The second being arithmetic operators. Different type of arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, %,
    //, **. The last three are modulus, floor division, and exponentiation.

    
    • The third being comparison operators. Different type of comparison operators are ==, !=, >, >=,
    <, <=. There are also some other comparison operators that we use. They are used as is, is not, in, 
    not in. 
        • is: returns True if both variables are the same object. 
        • is not: returns True if both variables are not the same object. 
        • in: returns True if the list contains a certain item, x in y. 
        • not in: returns True if the list does not have a certain item, x not in y.

    
    • The fourth kind of operators are logical operators. They are and, or, not. and returns True if both expressions
    are True. or returns True if one expression is True. not just flips the True or False.
