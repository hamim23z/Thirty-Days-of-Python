**Day 01 Quiz - Testing Knowledge and Syntax**

1. Comments
    -> There are two different types of comments, single line and multiline. Single is # and multiline is ''' or """


2. Data Types
    -> The different data types in Python are strings, numbers, floats, int, complex, boolean. More complex ones are lists,
      sets, tuples, and dictionaries.
      â€¢ In order to check what kind of data type it is, we can use the built in Python function type. So type(10) will return int.

**Day 02 Quiz - Testing Knowledge and Syntax**

1. Integer to Float
    random = 4
    new_float = float(random)
    print(new_float)


2. Float to Integer
    random2 = 3.14
    new_int = int(random2)
    print(new_int)


3. Integer to String
    random3 = 21
    new_string = str(random3)
    print(new_string)

And the other way is the same for them, just change the functions and whatnot.

**Day 03 Quiz - Testing Knowledge and Syntax**

1. Boolean Operators
    -> In Python, we have True and False.


2. Assignment Operators
    -> == means equal to
    -> != means not equal to
    -> += means a = a+b
    -> -= means a = a-b
    -> *= means a = a*b
    -> /= means a = a/b
    -> %= means a = a%b


3. Comparison Operators
    -> > means greater than
    -> >= means greater than or equal to
    -> < means less than
    -> <= means less than or equal to


4. Logical Operators
    -> and. This evaluates to True when both expressions are True
    -> or. This evaluates to True when at least one expression is True.
    -> not. This reverses, so True becomes False and False becomes True.
